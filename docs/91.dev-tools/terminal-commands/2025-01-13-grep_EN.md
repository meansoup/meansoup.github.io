`grep` is one of the most frequently used commands in Linux.  
For server developers, `grep` is essential when searching and analyzing logs or data.

## grep Options

Using `grep` as-is is fine, but there are some options that can make it more useful.  
Knowing `grep` and being able to use it efficiently are very different.

### Creating a File to Test grep options

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
with open("numbers.txt", 'w') as fw:
 for i in range(10000):
   fw.write("numbers: " + str(i) + " ...\n")
```

Before learning the options, let's create a test file for `grep`.  
The file will contain numbers from 0 to 9999 for testing.  
If something is unclear, working with a test file can make it easier to understand.

### Ignoring Case Sensitivity

```shell
grep Num numbers.txt
grep -i Num numbers.txt
```

**`grep -i`** **i**gnores case when searching.

### Limiting the Number of Matches

```shell
grep -m 5 1234 numbers.txt
```

**`grep -m 1`** prints only the first 1 line (**m**ax count) that matches.

### Displaying Line Numbers

```shell
grep -n 1234 numbers.txt
```

**`grep -n`** includes the line **n**umber where the match is found.

### Displaying Non-Matching Lines

```shell
grep -v 1 numbers.txt
```

**`grep -v`** outputs only the lines that don't match (**v**invert match).

### Restricting Output to a Specific Range

```shell
grep -o 1234 numbers.txt
grep -o ".\{0,3\}1234.\{0,3\}" numbers.txt
```

**`grep -o`** prints only the matching part of the line (**o**nly match).  
You can use regular expressions with `-o` to show only the surrounding context of the match.  
This is especially useful for long lines where you need to extract specific parts.

### OR Condition

```shell
grep -e 1234 -e 5678 numbers.txt
```

**`grep -e`** allows searching using multiple regular expressions, working like an OR condition.

### Displaying Lines Before and After Matches

```shell
grep -A 2 1234 numbers.txt
grep -B 2 1234 numbers.txt
grep -C 2 1234 numbers.txt
```

- **`grep -A 2`**: Displays 2 lines **A**fter the match.
- **`grep -B 2`**: Displays 2 lines **B**efore the match.
- **`grep -C 2`**: Displays 2 lines before and after the match.

### Displaying File Names

```shell
grep -H 1234 numbers.txt
grep -h 1234 numbers*
```

- **`grep -H`**: Includes the file name in the output.
- **`grep -h`**: Omits the file name from the output.

By default, the file name is shown when searching multiple files but omitted when searching a single file.

### Recursive Search

```shell
grep -r 1234 .
```

**`grep -r 1234 .`** searches recursively in the current directory.

### Counting Matches

```shell
grep -c 1234 numbers.txt
```

**`grep -c`** displays the count of matching lines.

## Advanced grep Usage

Using just `grep` might make you a beginner in command-line usage.  
Performance depends on how efficiently you combine `grep` with other commands.

### Basic Usage

```shell
grep 1234 numbers.txt
grep 1234 numbers.txt*
```

This is the simplest and most commonly used way to use `grep`.

### Using with Pipeline

 ```shell
 cat numbers.txt | grep 1234
 cat numbers.txt | grep 1234 | cut -d ':' -f 2
 ```

You can use `grep` more efficiently by combining it with other commands via pipelines.

### Using with tail

 ```shell
 tail -f numbers.txt | grep 1234
 tail -F numbers.txt | grep 1234
 ```

**`tail -f`** and **`tail -F`** are used to follow the lines added to a file in real-time.  
These are commonly used to analyze server logs as they are written.  
However, it's nearly impossible to monitor thousands of lines per second.  
By combining **tail** and **grep**, you can analyze only the desired logs in real-time.

**`tail -f`** Follows the current file.  
**`tail -F`** Follows based on the file name, even if the file is replaced.  

Logs often roll over to a new file based on time.   
With **-f**, if the file name changes due to rolling, no further logs will be shown.   
**-F**, on the other hand, continues following logs even after the file name changes.
