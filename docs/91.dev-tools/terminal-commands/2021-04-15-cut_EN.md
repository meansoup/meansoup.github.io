The **cut** command is one of the commands used to parse file data.  
It is highly efficient in the process of parsing and preprocessing data.

## Usability

1. When you want to view only part of a simple file, you can use `sed` or `awk`, but **cut** offers the best performance.
  - You can see a noticeable performance difference when dealing with large files over 1GB.
2. When you want to inspect large files, opening them with `vi` may take a long time, but with **cut**, you can view the content quickly.
3. If a single line is extremely large (for example, 10GB), you might not be able to open it with tools like `vi`. Since it's a single line, even `head` won't help you view it. In such cases, you can use **cut** to inspect the data.
  - Of course, using [split](/docs/dev-tools/linux-commands/split) in such scenarios is also a good option.
4. When using scripts like Python, preprocessing the data can significantly boost performance.

This kind of data preprocessing is very effective when dealing with large files that are simple and have a consistent format.
- When extracting userdata for batch processing.
- When parsing large amounts of simple, non-standard logs.

## How to Use

While there are several ways to use **cut**, the most common usage is with **cut -d -f**.  
It's also useful when you need to extract specific characters.

A limitation of **cut** is that it only allows you to cut by a single character, but there are many datasets where this is useful, and the performance is excellent.    
You can use it alongside other commands to parse data with consistent formats like db dumps, CSVs, and JSON files.   
It is frequently used for file parsing, data extraction, and in command pipes.

### Cutting by Delimiter

```bash
cut -d 'DELIMITER' -f INDEX FILE
```

**-d**:
- Option to specify the character to cut by.
- Since only a single character is allowed, you cannot use strings.

**-f**:
- Option to select which field(s) to extract after cutting.
- You can specify using `N`, `N-M`, or `N,M-L`.

### Ignoring Lines Without Delimiters

```bash
cut -d 'DELIMITER' -f INDEX -s FILE
```

**-s**:
- Option to skip lines that do not contain the delimiter.

### Changing the Delimiter

```bash
cut -d 'DELIMITER' -f INDEX --output-delimiter="OUTPUT DELIMITER" FILE
```

**--output-delimiter**:
- Specifies a string to replace the delimiter used in the output.

### Cutting by Character

```bash
cut -c INDEX
```

**-c**:
- Allows you to cut by character.
- You can specify ranges using `N`, `N-M`, or `N,M-L`.
