An epoch time converter that extracts and converts only the epoch time from a string containing the epoch time into a date and time.  
If I were to present it more appealingly, I'd call it the AI Epoch Time Converter.

When developing, there are many instances where you need to convert epoch time to DateTime.   
Typically, various websites allow you to input epoch time and output the corresponding DateTime.  
However, it can be inconvenient to pinpoint and convert just the epoch time from logs or data.  
It becomes even more cumbersome when you want to review multiple data points and check their values.

You can solve this issue through [https://backendbrew.com/epoch/](https://backendbrew.com/epoch/).

This site converts and displays all the epoch times contained within a string.
